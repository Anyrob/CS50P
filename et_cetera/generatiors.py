    1. There is a way to protect against your system running out of resources the problems they are addressing become too large.
    2. The yield generator can solve this problem by returning a small bit of the results at a time.
    3. Control C interrupts the program, so you don't have to wait for the 1,000,000 sheeps to be printed.
